                            Fly Fishing Net: While Catch and release fishing, a net is also a mandatory item. For catch and release fishing, it is essential to land the fish and remove the hook as easily as possible. A net makes landing the fish, and then removing the hook, far simpler than by trying to "beach the fish" and do it on-shore. Any fly shop should have a good selection of fly fishing nets. Stores that specialize in spin-fishing, however, aren't the best places to shop for a net. The reason is that nets used for spin fishing aren't designed to "hang from the back" of an angler like a fly fishing net is. Spin fishing nets also tend to be "deeper" and not as friendly for catch and release fishing.

                            Fly Floatant, also known as fly dressing, is an essential item for any angler. What fly floatant does is help keep flies buoyant. Or, to phrase another way, it keeps dry flies floating on the surface of water. Without fly floatant, what will happen is that dry flies will, soon after being used, become a bit waterlogged and no longer float properly. And a fly that doesn't float properly is a fly that the trout will happily ignore. To use fly floatant, ideally use on a fly that is perfectly dry. Than spray the floatant (or apply the dressing) to the fly. If the fly is already wet, give the fly a good shake (to remove as much water as possible). Then let the fly dry out for a minute or two before applying the floatant.

                            Polarized sunglasses, as most people know, cut through the glare. For fly fishing, what polarized sunglasses provide is a way to "see through the water's glare." In particular, polarized sunglasses allow an angler to better see into the water, not to mention to see their fly when it is floating on the water. Without polarized sunglasses, an angler might as well be "fishing blind." Yes, they are that important.
                            Sunglasses are a highly personal item. You can spend hundreds of dollars on fancy, stylish sunglasses. For fly fishing, however, while such glasses are wonderful to have they aren't especially needed. Basically, all but the cheapest pair of polarized sunglasses work well for "cutting through the glare."
